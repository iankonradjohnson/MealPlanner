## Instructions

### Prepare the Fish:
1. Ensure tilapia is very fresh and cold. Remove any bones with tweezers.
2. Cut fish into 1/2-inch cubes, removing any dark spots.
3. Place cubed fish in a glass or ceramic bowl (never metal).
4. Pour lime juice over fish, ensuring all pieces are covered.
5. Add salt and mix gently with a wooden spoon.
6. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours until fish turns opaque and "cooks" in the acid.

### Prepare the Vegetables:
1. Slice red onion paper-thin using a mandoline or sharp knife.
2. Soak onion slices in ice water for 15 minutes to reduce sharpness, then drain.
3. Seed and mince jalapeño finely.
4. Dice sweet potato into 1/4-inch cubes and boil for 8-10 minutes until tender, then cool.
5. Chop cilantro and mint leaves finely.

### Prepare the Corn:
1. If using fresh corn, boil ears for 5 minutes, cool, and cut kernels off cob.
2. If using frozen, thaw completely and pat dry.

### Assemble the Ceviche:
1. After fish has marinated 2 hours, drain and reserve 2 tbsp of the marinade.
2. Add drained onion, jalapeño, sweet potato, cilantro, and mint to the fish.
3. Mix gently and taste for seasoning.
4. Let stand 15 minutes for flavors to meld.

### Make the Leche de Tigre:
1. Combine reserved marinade, fresh lime juice, grated ginger, and minced garlic.
2. Season with salt to taste.

### To Serve:
1. Arrange ceviche in bowls or on plates.
2. Garnish with avocado slices and corn kernels.
3. Drizzle with leche de tigre.
4. Serve with plantain chips and lime wedges.

## Storage Instructions

- Ceviche is best consumed fresh but can be stored up to 2 days maximum
- Store in airtight glass container in refrigerator
- Do not freeze - the texture will be ruined
- Keep garnishes separate until serving

## Cultural Notes

Ceviche originates from Peru and is considered the country's national dish. The acid from lime juice "cooks" the fish through denaturation of proteins, the same process as heat cooking. Traditional Peruvian ceviche includes sweet potato and corn as classic accompaniments. The "leche de tigre" (tiger's milk) is the flavorful marinade that's often consumed as a hangover cure. Fresh, high-quality fish is essential - never use previously frozen fish for ceviche.
