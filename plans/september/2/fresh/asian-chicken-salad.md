## Cultural Notes

This salad draws inspiration from Chinese chicken salad traditions, featuring the classic combination of crisp vegetables with sesame-based dressing. The use of napa cabbage provides authentic texture while snow peas add traditional Chinese vegetable elements. Coconut aminos can substitute soy sauce for those avoiding gluten, maintaining the umami depth essential to East Asian flavors.
