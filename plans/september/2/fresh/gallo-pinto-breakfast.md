# Gallo Pinto - Costa Rican/Nicaraguan

**Type:** Fresh/Breakfast (with Frozen Components)
**Prep Time:** 20 minutes | **Cook Time:** 35 minutes | **Total:** 55 minutes
**Yield:** 21 portions (7 fresh + 14 frozen in silicon bricks)
**Storage:** Refrigerator (7 days) / Freezer (3 months)

## Ingredients

- 6 cups black beans, cooked (or 6 cans, drained and rinsed)
- 9 cups cooked white rice (preferably day-old)
- 3 medium red bell peppers, diced
- 3 medium onions, diced
- 12 cloves garlic, minced
- 3/4 cup cilantro, chopped
- 6 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1.5 teaspoons smoked paprika
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 6 tablespoons Salsa Lizano (or Worcestershire sauce as substitute)

**No-Cook Toppings (prepare fresh each morning):**
- 2-3 avocados for the week
- Fresh cilantro bunch
- 2-3 limes
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes
- Pickled jalape√±os
- Hot sauce of choice
- Optional: plantain chips for crunch

## Instructions

1. Work in batches if needed. Heat olive oil in your largest pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Add diced onions and bell peppers, cook for 8-10 minutes until softened.

2. Add minced garlic, cumin, and smoked paprika. Cook for another minute until fragrant.

3. Add the cooked black beans with about 1.5 cups of their cooking liquid (or water if using canned). Let simmer for 5 minutes.

4. Add the cooked rice in batches, breaking up any clumps. Mix thoroughly with the bean mixture. You may need to work in two pots if your largest pot isn't big enough.

5. Cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rice has absorbed the flavors and liquid. The mixture should be moist but not wet.

6. Stir in Salsa Lizano (or Worcestershire sauce) and chopped cilantro. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

7. Let cool completely before portioning - this is crucial for proper freezing.
