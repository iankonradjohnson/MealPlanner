## Cultural Notes

Çoban Salatası, literally "shepherd's salad," is Turkey's most beloved salad and a staple of Turkish cuisine. Traditionally eaten by shepherds who could gather these fresh ingredients while tending their flocks, this salad represents the essence of Turkish cooking: simple, fresh ingredients prepared without cooking. The pomegranate molasses adds the characteristic sweet-tart flavor that distinguishes this from similar Middle Eastern salads. In Turkey, this salad accompanies nearly every meal, especially grilled meats and kebabs. The key to authentic çoban salatası is uniform dicing - all vegetables should be cut to the same small size.
