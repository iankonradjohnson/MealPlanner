**Type:** Fresh/Breakfast
**Prep Time:** 10 minutes | **Chill Time:** Overnight | **Total:** 10 minutes active
**Yield:** 7 portions (breakfast for the week)
**Storage:** Refrigerator (5 days)

## Ingredients

**Base:**
- 3.5 cups rolled oats
- 4 cups unsweetened almond milk (or coconut milk)
- 1 cup coconut milk (canned, for creaminess)
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 cup chia seeds
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon rose water (light touch!)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
- Pinch of salt

**Toppings (add fresh each morning):**
- 1 cup shelled pistachios, roughly chopped
- 1/4 cup dried rose petals (food grade)
- Fresh berries (raspberries or strawberries)
- Pomegranate seeds (when in season)
- Coconut flakes
- Additional maple syrup or honey to taste
- Fresh mint leaves (optional)

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine oats, chia seeds, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt.

2. In a separate bowl or large measuring cup, whisk together almond milk, coconut milk, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and rose water.

3. Pour the liquid mixture over the oats and stir thoroughly to combine.

4. Divide the mixture evenly among 7 glass jars or containers (about 3/4 cup per container).

5. Cover and refrigerate overnight or for at least 4 hours.

6. The oats will thicken as they absorb the liquid. If too thick in the morning, add a splash of almond milk.

## Storage & Portioning

- Store covered in refrigerator for up to 5 days
- Best consumed within 5 days for optimal texture

## Serving Suggestions

Each morning, top with:
- 2 tablespoons chopped pistachios
- Small pinch of dried rose petals

## Notes

- The rose water should be subtle - just enough to add a floral note without overpowering
- Cardamom is the dominant flavor, complemented by the gentle rose
- Food-grade dried rose petals can be found at Middle Eastern markets or online
- For a prettier presentation, layer toppings artfully
- This recipe is inspired by Middle Eastern desserts like muhallabia and Persian love cake
