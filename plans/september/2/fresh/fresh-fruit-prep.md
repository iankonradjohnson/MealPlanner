## Cultural Notes

This fruit combination celebrates late summer abundance when stone fruits are at their peak. Peaches and plums have been cultivated for thousands of years across Mediterranean and Asian cultures. Kiwi, originally from China (called Chinese gooseberry), adds vitamin C and unique texture. The combination provides a balance of sweet and tart flavors while offering diverse textures and nutritional benefits.
