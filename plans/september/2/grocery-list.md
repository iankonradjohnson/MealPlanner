This is a **Light Prep Day** focusing on fresh preparations. Ceviche requires 2+ hours marinating time, so start early. Most dishes can be prepped in advance and assembled when ready to serve.

- Asian Chicken Salad: Store components separately, dress just before serving
- Fresh fruit: 3-5 days depending on fruit type
- Turkish Salad: Improves with marinating, up to 5 days storage

## Special Considerations
- Fresh fish quality is critical for ceviche - buy from reputable fishmonger
- Stone fruits should be ripe but firm for best texture after cutting
