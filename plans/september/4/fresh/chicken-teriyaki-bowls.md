## Cultural Notes

Teriyaki, meaning "shining grill" in Japanese, is a traditional cooking technique where ingredients are broiled or grilled with a glaze of soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. This preparation style originated in Japan during the 17th century and has become one of the most recognized Japanese flavors worldwide.

The use of chicken thighs instead of breast meat follows traditional Japanese preference for darker, more flavorful cuts. The vegetables are prepared using the blanching technique called "yukimono," which preserves color, texture, and nutrients while making them easily digestible.

Mirin, the sweet rice wine essential to authentic teriyaki, adds depth and a subtle sweetness that balances the saltiness of soy sauce. The sauce should have a glossy, lacquered appearance when properly prepared - this is the "teri" (shine) that gives the dish its name.
