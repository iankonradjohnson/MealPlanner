## Cultural Notes

Antipasto, literally meaning "before the meal" in Italian, represents one of the most beloved traditions in Italian dining. This salad captures the essence of a traditional antipasto platter in a more portable, meal-prep friendly format.

The combination of preserved vegetables, olives, and high-quality olive oil reflects the Italian mastery of food preservation techniques developed over centuries. Each ingredient serves a purpose: the briny olives and capers provide umami depth, the acidic vegetables (artichokes, peppers) add brightness, and the aromatic herbs connect all the flavors.

Traditional antipasto varies significantly by region - Northern Italian versions might include more vegetables and nuts, while Southern versions lean heavily on olives, peppers, and preserved vegetables. This dairy-free adaptation maintains authenticity while accommodating dietary restrictions.

The key to an exceptional antipasto salad lies in the quality of ingredients - seek out good Italian or Greek olives, properly roasted peppers, and high-quality extra virgin olive oil. The dressing should be assertive enough to complement the bold flavors of the preserved vegetables without overwhelming the fresh greens.
