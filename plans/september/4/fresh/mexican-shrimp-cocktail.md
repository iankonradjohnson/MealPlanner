## Cultural Notes

Coctel de Camarones is a beloved Mexican seafood dish that originated in the coastal regions of Mexico, particularly popular in states like Sinaloa and Sonora. This refreshing cocktail is often enjoyed as a weekend treat or special occasion dish, typically served during hot afternoons.

The dish represents the Mexican approach to seafood - fresh, bright, and full of contrasting flavors and textures. The combination of tangy lime, spicy peppers, and cool cucumber creates a perfect balance that's both refreshing and satisfying.

Traditional preparation emphasizes the importance of using the freshest possible shrimp and properly balancing the acidity of the tomato base. The cocktail should be served ice-cold and eaten with Mexican saltine crackers called "Saladitas," which provide a perfect textural contrast to the tender shrimp and crisp vegetables.

In Mexico, this dish is often enjoyed at marisquerias (seafood restaurants) and is considered both a hangover cure and a perfect beach-day meal. The presentation in tall glasses mimics the American shrimp cocktail but with distinctly Mexican flavors and preparation methods.
