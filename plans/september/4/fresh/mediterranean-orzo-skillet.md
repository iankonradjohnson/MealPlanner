## Cultural Notes

This dish brings together the best of Mediterranean coastal cooking, where orzo is beloved from Italy to Greece to the Middle East. The combination of eggplant, zucchini, and peppers reflects the classic Mediterranean trilogy found in dishes like ratatouille and caponata.

The use of tahini and coconut milk creates a dairy-free creaminess that's inspired by Middle Eastern cooking techniques. Tahini, made from ground sesame seeds, is a staple throughout the Levant and adds a subtle nuttiness that complements the vegetables beautifully.

The technique of toasting the orzo adds depth, while the gradual addition of broth creates a risotto-like creaminess. The abundance of fresh herbs at the end is characteristic of Mediterranean cooking, where herbs are used generously to brighten rich dishes.

This modern interpretation respects traditional flavors while accommodating dairy-free diets, proving that dietary restrictions need not compromise on taste or satisfaction. The result is a warming, nourishing dish that captures the sun-drenched flavors of the Mediterranean in every bite.
