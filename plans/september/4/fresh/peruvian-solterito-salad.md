## Cultural Notes

Solterito is a traditional Peruvian salad that originated in Arequipa, Peru's second-largest city. The name "solterito" roughly translates to "little bachelor," possibly referring to its simple, uncomplicated preparation that even bachelors could master.

This salad represents the Peruvian love for fresh, simple ingredients combined with bright acidic flavors. Lima beans, native to Peru, are the star ingredient and reflect the country's ancient agricultural heritage. The Incas cultivated lima beans thousands of years ago, and they remain a staple in Peruvian cuisine today.

The traditional version often includes queso fresco (fresh cheese), but this dairy-free adaptation maintains the salad's essential character while accommodating dietary restrictions. The key is in the balance of textures - creamy beans, sweet corn, briny olives, and the brightness of fresh lime juice.

In Peru, Solterito is often served as a side dish with grilled meats or as part of a larger spread of salads. It's particularly popular during summer months and festivals, representing the vibrant, fresh flavors that characterize much of Peruvian coastal cuisine. The use of lime juice not only adds flavor but also helps preserve the salad, making it perfect for meal prep.
