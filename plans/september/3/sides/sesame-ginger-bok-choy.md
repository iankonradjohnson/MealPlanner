## Cultural Notes
Bok choy (白菜, literally "white vegetable") is one of the most popular leafy greens in Chinese cuisine. This preparation showcases the vegetable's natural sweetness while adding the classic Chinese flavor combination of ginger, garlic, and sesame.

The blanching technique ensures the bok choy retains its bright green color and crisp-tender texture, even after freezing and reheating. This is a traditional Cantonese-style preparation that pairs perfectly with any Chinese main dish.

The contrast between the mild, slightly sweet bok choy and the aromatic ginger-garlic oil makes this an excellent side dish that doesn't compete with stronger flavors.

## Cooking Tips
- **Blanching water:** Use plenty of salted water for even cooking
- **Ice bath:** Consider shocking in ice water after blanching for optimal color retention
- **Wok hei:** If you have a wok, use high heat for authentic "breath of the wok" flavor
- **Texture:** Don't overcook - bok choy should be crisp-tender, not mushy

## Variations
- **Spicy version:** Add more red pepper flakes or fresh chilies
- **Oyster sauce version:** Add 1 tbsp oyster sauce (ensure dairy-free) to the sauce mixture
- **Shanghai style:** Use Shanghai bok choy (larger, greener variety) cut into 2-inch pieces

## Cost Breakdown
- Baby bok choy (4 lbs): $8-10
- Aromatics and seasonings: $2-3
- Oils and sauces: $1-2
- **Total estimated cost:** $10-12 ($0.85-1.00 per serving)
