## Cultural Notes
Greek orzo salad (Kritharaki Salata) is a staple at Greek summer gatherings. Unlike hot pasta dishes, this refreshing salad is perfect for warm weather. The combination of orzo (which means "barley" in Italian but is called kritharaki in Greek) with fresh vegetables and tangy feta represents the Mediterranean diet at its finest.

## Cooking Tips
- **Orzo cooking:** Don't overcook - should be al dente as it will soften slightly when dressed
- **Vegetable size:** Cut vegetables similar size to the orzo for best texture
- **Dressing:** The salad absorbs dressing as it sits, so reserve some for refreshing
- **Make-ahead:** Flavors improve after sitting for a few hours

## Cost Breakdown
- Orzo pasta: $3-4
- Fresh vegetables: $6-8
- Feta cheese: $4-5
- Olives: $3-4
- Herbs and dressing: $3-4
- **Total estimated cost:** $19-25 (~$1.60-2.10 per serving)
