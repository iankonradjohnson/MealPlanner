## Cultural Notes
Gigantes Plaki is a beloved Greek comfort food, especially popular during Lent when Orthodox Greeks avoid meat and dairy. The name "gigantes" refers to the large lima beans that are essential to this dish.

This is a dish that improves with time - the flavors meld beautifully overnight. In Greece, it's often served as a main course with crusty bread and olives, but it makes an excellent side dish for meat-based meals.

The key to authentic flavor is using high-quality canned tomatoes and good olive oil. Don't skip the final drizzle of olive oil before serving - it's traditional and adds richness.

## Cooking Tips
- **Bean texture:** Don't fully cook the beans in the first stage; they'll finish cooking in the oven
- **Liquid level:** Beans should be just covered with liquid; too much makes it soupy
- **Sauce consistency:** The final dish should be saucy but not watery

## Cost Breakdown
- Giant lima beans (2 lbs dried): $4-5
- Canned tomatoes: $2-3
- Vegetables and aromatics: $3-4
- Olive oil and seasonings: $2-3
- **Total estimated cost:** $8-10 ($0.65-0.85 per serving)
