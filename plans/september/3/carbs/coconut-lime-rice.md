## Instructions

### Prep Phase (10 minutes)
1. **Rinse rice:**
   - Rinse jasmine rice in fine-mesh strainer until water runs clear
   - This removes excess starch for fluffy rice

2. **Prep citrus:**
   - Zest limes before juicing (easier when whole)
   - Juice limes to get 1/4 cup
   - Slice ginger if using

3. **Prep finish ingredients:**
   - Chop cilantro
   - Toast coconut flakes in dry pan 2-3 minutes until golden

### Cooking Phase (25 minutes)
1. **Combine liquids (5 minutes):**
   - In large, heavy-bottomed pot, combine coconut milk and water
   - Add salt, sugar, and bay leaves
   - Add ginger slices if using
   - Bring to gentle simmer over medium heat

2. **Add rice (2 minutes):**
   - Add rinsed rice to simmering coconut mixture
   - Stir once to distribute evenly
   - Return to gentle simmer

3. **Cook rice (18 minutes):**
   - Reduce heat to low
   - Cover and cook 18 minutes without lifting lid
   - Rice should absorb most liquid

4. **Rest and fluff:**
   - Remove from heat, keep covered
   - Let stand 5 minutes to finish steaming
   - Remove bay leaves and ginger slices

5. **Add citrus (5 minutes):**
   - Fluff rice with fork
   - Stir in lime zest and lime juice
   - Fold in chopped cilantro
   - Taste and adjust seasoning

### Storage & Portioning
1. **Cool completely:** Spread on sheet pan to cool quickly (prevents mushiness)
2. **Portion:** Divide among 6 silicon brick containers (~1.5 cups each)
3. **Pack loosely:** Don't compress rice
4. **Freeze:** Lay flat in freezer for efficient storage
5. **Label:** Include dish name and freeze date

## Reheating Instructions
- **From frozen:** Microwave 2-3 minutes with 1-2 tbsp water, stir halfway through
- **Stovetop:** Steam in covered pot with splash of water 3-5 minutes
- **Rice cooker:** Add to rice cooker with 2-3 tbsp water, steam setting

## Cultural Notes
Coconut rice appears in many tropical cuisines, from Caribbean rice and peas to Thai khao tom. This Latin American version balances the richness of coconut milk with bright lime acidity.

In Brazilian cuisine, this type of rice often accompanies seafood and grilled meats. The coconut milk adds richness and subtle sweetness that pairs beautifully with spicy or heavily seasoned dishes.

The key is balancing the coconut richness with citrus brightness - the lime juice added at the end keeps the flavors fresh and prevents the dish from being too heavy.

## Cooking Tips
- **Rice choice:** Jasmine rice works best for its texture and subtle floral aroma
- **Liquid ratio:** 1:1.5 ratio of rice to total liquid (coconut milk + water)
- **Gentle heat:** Keep heat low once covered to prevent scorching
- **Steam finish:** The 5-minute rest is crucial for proper texture

## Variations
- **Coconut curry rice:** Add 1 tsp curry powder and turmeric
- **Pineapple coconut rice:** Fold in diced fresh pineapple at the end
- **Spicy version:** Add minced jalape√±o or scotch bonnet pepper
- **Herb variation:** Use mint instead of cilantro for different flavor profile

## Pairing Suggestions
- Perfect with Brazilian Chicken and Black Bean Stew
- Complements spicy dishes and grilled meats
- Excellent base for curry dishes
- Great with tropical fruit salads

## Cost Breakdown
- Jasmine rice (3 cups): $2-3
- Coconut milk (2 cans): $3-4
- Limes and aromatics: $1-2
- **Total estimated cost:** $6-8 ($0.50-0.65 per serving)
