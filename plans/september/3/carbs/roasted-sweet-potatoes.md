## Cultural Notes
Sweet potatoes are enjoyed worldwide but are particularly significant in American Southern cuisine, African cooking, and various Asian preparations. This herb-roasted version draws from Mediterranean flavors while keeping the preparation simple and universal.

The high heat roasting creates caramelization on the outside while keeping the interior creamy and sweet. The herb blend adds earthy, aromatic notes that complement the natural sweetness of the potatoes.

## Cooking Tips
- **Uniform cutting:** Keep pieces the same size for even cooking
- **Don't overcrowd:** This causes steaming instead of roasting
- **High heat:** 425°F is ideal for caramelization
- **Texture contrast:** Look for golden, slightly crispy edges

## Variations
- **Mediterranean:** Add oregano, lemon zest, and olives
- **Middle Eastern:** Use za'atar, sumac, and pine nuts
- **Mexican:** Add chili powder, lime juice, and cilantro
- **Indian:** Use curry powder, turmeric, and fresh ginger
