## Cultural Notes
Sunomono (literally "vinegared things") is a category of Japanese salads dressed with seasoned rice vinegar. This cucumber and wakame version is one of the most popular and is considered a palate cleanser.

The salting and draining of cucumbers is essential - it removes bitterness and excess water while creating the perfect crisp-tender texture. The wakame adds umami depth and oceanic flavor.

This dish is traditionally served as a small side dish (kobachi) in Japanese meals, helping to balance richer, heavier dishes with its clean, refreshing taste.

## Cooking Tips
- **Cucumber prep:** Don't skip the salting step - it's crucial for texture
- **Paper-thin slices:** Use a mandoline if possible for uniform, thin slices
- **Wakame quality:** Look for wakame from Japan or Korea for best flavor
- **Balance:** The dressing should be tart but balanced, not too sweet or salty

## Serving Suggestions
- Perfect palate cleanser with rich dishes like red-cooked pork belly
- Excellent alongside any fried or grilled foods
- Traditional accompaniment to sushi and sashimi
- Great with rice bowls and noodle dishes

## Variations
- **Tako sunomono:** Add cooked octopus pieces
- **Ebi sunomono:** Include cooked shrimp
- **Daikon sunomono:** Use daikon radish instead of cucumber
- **Spicy version:** Add thin slices of fresh chili

## Health Benefits
- Low calorie and refreshing
- Wakame provides iodine and minerals
- Cucumbers are hydrating and contain silica
- Rice vinegar aids digestion

## Cost Breakdown
- English cucumbers (2 large): $3-4

- **Total estimated cost:** $6-8 ($1.50-2.00 per serving)
