## Cultural Notes
This tropical fruit combination draws from Latin American, Caribbean, and Southeast Asian fruit traditions. The trio of pineapple, mango, and papaya represents the classic tropical flavor profile.

Lime juice not only prevents browning but also enhances the natural flavors of the fruits, a technique used throughout Latin America. The addition of mint is inspired by Caribbean and Middle Eastern fruit salads.

## Preparation Tips
- **Ripeness check:** Fruits should yield slightly to pressure and smell fragrant
- **Pineapple test:** Bottom should smell sweet, not fermented
- **Mango test:** Should give slightly when pressed, especially near stem end
- **Papaya test:** Skin should be mostly yellow with some green

## Seasonal Considerations
- **Peak season:** Most tropical fruits are best in late summer/early fall
- **Storage temperature:** Keep refrigerated but not too cold (damages texture)
- **Ethylene sensitivity:** Store away from apples and bananas which speed ripening

## Nutritional Benefits
- **Vitamin C:** Especially high in pineapple and papaya
- **Beta-carotene:** Abundant in mango and papaya
- **Digestive enzymes:** Bromelain in pineapple, papain in papaya
- **Fiber:** All fruits provide good fiber content

## Cost Breakdown
- Pineapples (2 large): $6-8
- Mangoes (3): $3-4
- Papayas (2 large): $4-6
- Limes and optional additions: $2-3
- **Total estimated cost:** $12-15 ($0.80-1.25 per serving)

## Make-Ahead Tips
- **Best timing:** Prepare maximum 3 days ahead
- **Lime juice:** Essential for maintaining color and flavor
- **Container choice:** Glass containers work best for maintaining freshness
- **Portioning:** Pre-portion for easy grab-and-go servings
