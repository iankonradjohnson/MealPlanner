## Cultural Notes
Stifado is one of Greece's most beloved comfort foods, traditionally made with rabbit or beef. The combination of sweet pearl onions, warm spices (cinnamon and allspice), and slow-braised meat creates the signature flavor profile. This dish improves with time as the flavors meld together.

The use of chuck roast instead of expensive cuts makes this budget-friendly while maintaining authenticity. Pearl onions are essential for the traditional presentation, but small shallots work as a substitute.

## Cost Breakdown
- Chuck roast (4 lbs): $20-24
- Pearl onions (2 lbs): $4-5
- Tomatoes and aromatics: $6-8
- **Total estimated cost:** $25-30 ($2.10-2.50 per serving)
