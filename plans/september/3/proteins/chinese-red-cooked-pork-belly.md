   - Drain and rinse under cold water, pat dry

2. **Brown the pork (15 minutes):**

## Cultural Notes
Red-cooked pork belly (hong shao rou) is a quintessential Shanghai dish and one of Chairman Mao's favorites. The "red cooking" technique uses dark soy sauce and rock sugar to create the characteristic deep red color and glossy finish.

The key to authentic flavor is the balance of sweet, salty, and umami from the rock sugar, soy sauces, and fermented black beans. Star anise provides the signature aromatic note that distinguishes this from other braised pork dishes.

Traditional recipes often include hard-boiled eggs added during the last 30 minutes of cooking, but we're keeping this dairy-free and focused on the pork.

## Cost Breakdown
- Pork belly (4 lbs): $16-20
- Soy sauces and seasonings: $3-4
- Aromatics and spices: $1-1
- **Total estimated cost:** $20-25 ($1.65-2.10 per serving)
