## Cultural Notes
This is a lighter version of Brazil's national dish, feijoada. Traditional feijoada uses various cuts of pork and beef, but this chicken version maintains the essential flavors while being more budget-friendly and quicker to prepare.

The sofrito (refogado in Portuguese) is the aromatic base that gives Brazilian dishes their distinctive flavor. The combination of onions, garlic, peppers, and tomatoes creates the foundation for countless Brazilian stews.

Black beans are essential - they're different from other bean varieties and provide the authentic taste and creamy texture when cooked properly.

## Cooking Tips
- **Bean texture:** Don't overcook the beans in the first stage; they'll continue cooking in the stew
- **Chicken choice:** Bone-in thighs provide more flavor than breasts and stay moist during long cooking
- **Acid balance:** The lime juice added at the end brightens the entire dish

## Cost Breakdown
- Chicken thighs (3 lbs): $9-12
- Black beans (2 cups dried): $3-4
- Vegetables and aromatics: $6-8
- **Total estimated cost:** $18-22 ($1.50-1.85 per serving)
