## Prep Day Overview
This is a **Heavy Prep Day** with 7 frozen dishes requiring 8-10 hours of cooking time. Start dried beans soaking the night before. Begin with longest-cooking items (beef stifado, Brazilian stew) in the morning, then pork belly. Rice and vegetables can cook while proteins braise.

## Storage Notes
- All proteins, sides, and rice will be frozen in silicon brick containers
- Tropical fruit prep stored in refrigerator for 3-4 days
- Sunomono best consumed within 24 hours
- Label all frozen containers with contents and date

## Special Considerations
- Soak giant lima beans and black beans overnight before prep day
- Dried wakame needs rehydration time
- Some specialty Asian ingredients may require trips to Asian grocery stores
- Fresh tropical fruits should be ripe but firm for best cutting results
