## Ingredients

### Vegetables
- 3 large zucchini (about 2 lbs), cut into 1-inch chunks
- 2 large eggplants (about 2 lbs), cut into 1-inch cubes
- 3 large bell peppers (red, yellow, orange), cut into 1-inch strips
- 2 large red onions, cut into thick wedges
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
- 8 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled

### Seasoning
- 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 1 tbsp dried oregano (or 3 tbsp fresh)
- 2 tsp dried thyme (or 2 tbsp fresh)
- 1 tsp dried rosemary, crushed
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)

### Finishing
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 tbsp fresh basil, chopped (or 2 tsp dried)
- 2 tbsp capers, drained (optional)
- 1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted (optional)

## Instructions

### Preparation
1. **Preheat oven:** Preheat to 425°F (220°C). Position racks in upper and lower thirds of oven.

2. **Prep vegetables:** Cut all vegetables as specified. For eggplant, salt the pieces and let sit in a colander for 15 minutes, then pat dry (this removes bitterness).

3. **Make seasoning mixture:** In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, thyme, rosemary, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.

### Cooking
4. **Toss vegetables:** Add all prepared vegetables to the seasoning mixture and toss thoroughly to coat evenly.

5. **Arrange on sheets:** Divide vegetables between two large rimmed baking sheets, spreading in a single layer. Don't overcrowd - vegetables should have space around them.

6. **Roast:** Place both pans in oven and roast for 20 minutes.

7. **Flip and rotate:** Stir vegetables and rotate pans (swap positions and turn 180 degrees). Continue roasting for 15-20 minutes until vegetables are tender and edges are golden brown.

8. **Check doneness:** Vegetables should be caramelized on the edges and fork-tender. Cherry tomatoes should be bursting and slightly jammy.

### Finishing
9. **Cool slightly:** Let vegetables cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets.

10. **Final seasoning:** Transfer to a large bowl and toss with fresh parsley, basil, capers, and pine nuts if using. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, or lemon juice as needed.

### Storage & Portioning
11. **Cool completely:** Allow to cool to room temperature before freezing.

12. **Portion:** Divide vegetables evenly among 6 silicon brick containers (about 1.5 cups per container).

13. **Freeze:** Lay flat in freezer until solid, then stack for storage.

## Reheating Instructions
- **From frozen:** Place in 375°F oven for 15-20 minutes until heated through
- **From refrigerated:** Place in 375°F oven for 8-10 minutes
- **Microwave:** Defrost first, then microwave on 70% power for 2-3 minutes per serving
- **Stovetop:** Sauté in a bit of olive oil over medium heat for 5-7 minutes

## Cultural Notes
This dish is inspired by "Briam," a traditional Greek mixed vegetable casserole, and similar preparations found throughout the Mediterranean. The technique of roasting vegetables with olive oil, herbs, and lemon reflects the ancient cooking methods of the region.

In Mediterranean cultures, these vegetables represent the abundance of summer harvests and are often prepared when gardens are overflowing. The combination of eggplant, zucchini, and peppers is classic in Greek, Italian, and southern French cooking.

The slow roasting process concentrates the vegetables' natural sugars while the olive oil and herbs add layers of flavor that have sustained Mediterranean peoples for millennia. This dish embodies the Mediterranean philosophy of letting simple, quality ingredients shine.

## Tips for Success
- Don't skip salting the eggplant - it prevents bitterness
- Cut vegetables uniformly for even cooking
- Don't overcrowd the pans - use three pans if necessary
- Vegetables should sizzle when they hit the hot oil
- Taste and adjust seasoning while warm
- Save any pan juices - they're perfect for drizzling over grains
- For extra flavor, add a splash of balsamic vinegar at the end
