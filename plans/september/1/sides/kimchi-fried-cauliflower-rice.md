## Instructions

### Preparation
1. **Make cauliflower rice:** Working in batches, pulse cauliflower florets in a food processor until they resemble rice-sized pieces. Don't over-process into mush. You should have about 8-10 cups.

2. **Prep kimchi:** Drain kimchi, reserving 1/4 cup of the juice. Roughly chop kimchi into smaller pieces.

3. **Make sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, kimchi juice, gochugaru, and white pepper.

### Cooking
4. **Cook cauliflower rice:** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large wok or wide skillet over medium-high heat. Add cauliflower rice and salt. Stir-fry for 5-6 minutes until tender but still with some texture. Transfer to a large bowl.

5. **Cook aromatics:** In the same pan, add remaining 1 tbsp oil. Add garlic, ginger, and white parts of green onions. Stir-fry for 30 seconds until fragrant.

6. **Add kimchi:** Add chopped kimchi and cook for 2-3 minutes until slightly caramelized and fragrant.

7. **Combine:** Return cauliflower rice to the pan and add the sauce mixture. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until well combined and heated through.

8. **Finish:** Remove from heat and stir in sesame oil, green parts of green onions, and half the sesame seeds.

### Storage & Portioning
9. **Cool completely:** Allow to cool to room temperature before freezing.

10. **Portion:** Divide kimchi fried cauliflower rice evenly among 6 silicon brick containers (about 1.5 cups per container).

11. **Freeze:** Lay flat in freezer until solid, then stack for storage.

## Reheating Instructions
- **From frozen:** Place in 375°F oven for 12-15 minutes, stirring halfway through
- **From refrigerated:** Heat a bit of oil in a skillet over medium heat, add cauliflower rice, and stir-fry for 3-5 minutes until heated through
- **Microwave:** Defrost first, then microwave on 70% power for 2-3 minutes per serving, stirring halfway through

## Cultural Notes
This dish is a modern fusion creation that combines traditional Korean kimchi fried rice ("kimchi bokkeumbap") with the contemporary low-carb trend of cauliflower rice. While not traditional, it honors the Korean technique of transforming leftover kimchi into a flavorful, satisfying dish.

Kimchi fried rice has been a Korean comfort food for generations, traditionally made to use up aging kimchi that had become too sour to eat fresh. The fermented cabbage adds probiotics, umami depth, and a characteristic tangy-spicy flavor that defines Korean cuisine.

The technique of stir-frying at high heat is fundamental to Korean cooking, creating the "wok hei" or breath of the wok that gives the dish its distinctive smoky flavor. This adaptation maintains those principles while creating a lighter, vegetable-forward version.

## Tips for Success
- Don't make cauliflower rice too fine - some texture is good
- Squeeze excess moisture from kimchi if it's very wet
- Use well-fermented kimchi for best flavor (slightly sour is perfect)
- Cook in batches if your pan isn't large enough
- Taste and adjust seasoning - kimchi saltiness varies
- For extra umami, add a splash of fish sauce (if not keeping vegetarian)
- Fresh kimchi can be used but increase cooking time slightly
