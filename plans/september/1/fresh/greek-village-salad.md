## Cultural Notes
Horiatiki, meaning "village salad," is the authentic Greek salad that bears little resemblance to American "Greek salads" with lettuce. This rustic dish originated in rural Greek villages where farmers would combine the freshest ingredients available during summer harvest season.

Traditional horiatiki never contains lettuce - this is a modern American addition. The authentic version celebrates the pure flavors of peak-season tomatoes, crisp cucumbers, and sharp feta cheese, all united by Greece's liquid gold: extra virgin olive oil.

In Greek culture, this salad represents the philosophy of using simple, high-quality ingredients at their peak. It's often served as a light meal with bread, embodying the Mediterranean approach to eating - fresh, seasonal, and shared with family.

The thick slab of feta on top is traditional - it's meant to be broken up and mixed in by each diner, not pre-crumbled. This method keeps the cheese from becoming soggy while allowing everyone to get their preferred amount.

## Tips for Success
- Use the ripest, best-quality tomatoes you can find
- Don't overdress - the vegetables should glisten, not swim
- Salt the tomatoes lightly 10 minutes before serving to draw out juices
- Use Greek oregano if possible - it's more potent than regular oregano
- Serve with warm pita bread or crusty sourdough
- For dairy-free version, focus on increasing the olive oil quality and oregano
- This salad is about showcasing individual ingredient flavors, not masking them
