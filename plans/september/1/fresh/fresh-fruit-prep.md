### Optional Additions

## Instructions

### Citrus Preparation
1. **Prep oranges:** Using a sharp knife, cut away peel and white pith. Cut between membranes to create clean segments. Store in airtight container.

2. **Prep grapefruit:** Same technique as oranges - remove all white pith and segment cleanly. Store separately from oranges.

3. **Juice citrus:** Extract juice from lemons and limes. Store in small containers or ice cube trays for easy portioning.

4. **Zest lemons:** Use a microplane to zest lemons before juicing. Store zest in freezer for future use.

### Apple and Pear Preparation
5. **Prep apples:** Wash and core apples. Cut into wedges or slices. To prevent browning, toss with a small amount of lemon juice.

6. **Prep pears:** Core and slice pears. Like apples, toss with lemon juice to prevent browning.

### Berry and Grape Preparation
7. **Clean berries:** Gently rinse berries and remove any stems or damaged fruit. Pat dry with paper towels.

8. **Prep grapes:** Remove grapes from stems and rinse. Store in breathable container.

### Daily Fresh Items
9. **Bananas:** Peel and slice fresh each morning to prevent browning.

10. **Avocados:** Cut fresh daily. Store unused halves with pit intact and a bit of lemon juice.

### Storage & Organization
11. **Container system:** Use clear, airtight containers labeled with contents and prep date.

12. **Refrigerator organization:** Store citrus in crisper drawer, berries on shelves where they won't get crushed.

13. **Daily portions:** Pre-portion into grab-and-go containers for easy weekday access.

## Cultural Notes
Fresh fruit preparation reflects global traditions of ending meals with nature's sweetness. In Mediterranean cultures, fresh fruit often replaces dessert, providing natural sugars and vitamins after savory meals.

The practice of preparing fruit in advance comes from institutional cooking and busy family traditions where efficiency meets nutrition. This approach ensures consistent fruit intake while reducing daily prep time.

Different cultures emphasize different fruits - citrus in Mediterranean climates, tropical fruits in Latin America, and seasonal stone fruits in temperate regions. This selection focuses on widely available, budget-friendly options.

## Tips for Success
- Buy fruit at different stages of ripeness for continuous supply
- Use the ripest fruit first
- Save citrus juice for salad dressings and marinades
- Freeze overripe fruit for smoothies
- Clean berries just before eating if not eating within 2 days
- Store cut fruit away from vegetables to prevent cross-contamination
- Keep a fruit bowl on the counter for immediate consumption items
