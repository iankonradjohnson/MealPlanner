- 1 tsp kosher salt

- 2 tbsp fresh chives, chopped
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves (or 1 tsp dried)
- 2 bay leaves
- Zest of 1 lemon

### Add-ins
- 1/3 cup golden raisins or dried cranberries
- 1/3 cup toasted pine nuts or slivered almonds
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

## Instructions

### Preparation
1. **Rinse quinoa:** Place quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold water until water runs clear, about 2 minutes. Drain well.

2. **Toast quinoa (optional):** For extra nutty flavor, heat a dry large saucepan over medium heat. Add quinoa and toast, stirring frequently, for 3-4 minutes until fragrant and slightly golden.

### Cooking
3. **Sauté aromatics:** Heat olive oil in the same large saucepan over medium heat. Add diced onion and cook for 5-6 minutes until softened and translucent. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

4. **Add quinoa:** Add the rinsed (and toasted, if using) quinoa to the pan. Stir to coat with oil and cook for 1-2 minutes.

5. **Add liquid:** Add broth, salt, pepper, thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil.

6. **Simmer:** Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-18 minutes until liquid is absorbed and quinoa is tender.

7. **Rest:** Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.

### Finishing
8. **Fluff and season:** Remove bay leaves. Fluff quinoa with a fork. Stir in fresh parsley, dill, chives, lemon zest, raisins, and nuts.

9. **Final touches:** Drizzle with lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.

### Storage & Portioning
10. **Cool completely:** Allow to cool to room temperature before freezing.

11. **Portion:** Divide quinoa pilaf evenly among 6 silicon brick containers (about 1.5 cups per container).

12. **Freeze:** Lay flat in freezer until solid, then stack for storage.

## Reheating Instructions
- **From frozen:** Place in covered dish, 350°F oven for 15-18 minutes until heated through
- **From refrigerated:** Microwave on 70% power for 2-3 minutes, or heat in saucepan with splash of broth
- **Stovetop:** Add 2-3 tbsp broth or water, heat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 3-5 minutes

## Cultural Notes
While quinoa pilaf is a modern adaptation, it draws inspiration from traditional Middle Eastern and Mediterranean rice pilafs that have been prepared for centuries. The technique of toasting grains before adding liquid comes from Persian "polo" and Turkish "pilav" traditions.

Quinoa itself is ancient - cultivated by the Incas in the Andes for over 4,000 years and considered sacred as "chisaya mama" (mother of all grains). This preparation honors both the ancient grain and the timeless pilaf technique that transforms simple ingredients into an elegant, fluffy side dish.

The addition of fresh herbs reflects the Mediterranean tradition of using whatever grows seasonally, while the nuts and dried fruit echo the Persian influence on pilaf preparations throughout the ancient Silk Road.

## Tips for Success
- Always rinse quinoa to remove bitter saponins
- Use a 1:1.5 ratio of quinoa to liquid for fluffy results
- Don't skip the resting period - it allows steam to finish cooking
- Toast quinoa for deeper, nuttier flavor
- Fresh herbs added at the end keep their bright flavor
- Save any leftover herb stems for making broth
- This pilaf pairs beautifully with the Greek chicken's pan juices
