## Ingredients

### Rice Base
- 3 cups long-grain white rice (like jasmine or basmati)
- 1/3 cup vegetable oil
- 1 large white onion, finely diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

### Liquid & Flavor Base
- 1 large tomato, cored and quartered
- 4.5 cups warm chicken or vegetable broth
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/4 tsp dried oregano (preferably Mexican)
- 1 bay leaf

### Vegetables & Garnish
- 1 cup frozen peas (optional)
- 1/2 cup carrots, finely diced (optional)
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- Lime wedges for serving

## Instructions

### Preparation
1. **Prep tomato base:** In a blender, combine the quartered tomato with 1/2 cup of the warm broth. Blend until smooth and set aside.

2. **Prepare ingredients:** Dice onion and carrot (if using), mince garlic, and measure out all spices.

### Cooking
3. **Toast rice:** Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add rice and stir to coat. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5-8 minutes until rice is lightly golden and fragrant. Some grains may start to turn white.

4. **Add aromatics:** Add diced onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until softened. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

5. **Add tomato mixture:** Stir in the blended tomato mixture, tomato paste, cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the mixture darkens slightly.

6. **Add liquid:** Slowly pour in the remaining warm broth (mixture will bubble vigorously). Add bay leaf and carrots if using. Bring to a boil.

7. **Simmer:** Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 18-20 minutes until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed.

8. **Add peas:** If using frozen peas, stir them in during the last 5 minutes of cooking.

9. **Rest:** Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.

### Finishing
10. **Fluff and garnish:** Remove bay leaf. Fluff rice with a fork and stir in fresh cilantro. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

### Storage & Portioning
11. **Cool completely:** Allow to cool to room temperature before freezing.

12. **Portion:** Divide Mexican rice evenly among 6 silicon brick containers (about 1.5 cups per container).

13. **Freeze:** Lay flat in freezer until solid, then stack for storage.

## Reheating Instructions
- **From frozen:** Place in covered dish, 350°F oven for 15-20 minutes until heated through
- **From refrigerated:** Microwave on 70% power for 2-3 minutes, or heat in saucepan with splash of broth
- **Stovetop:** Add 2-3 tbsp broth or water, heat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 4-6 minutes

## Cultural Notes
Mexican rice, known as "Arroz Rojo" (red rice) or "Arroz a la Mexicana," is a cornerstone of Mexican cuisine that arrived with Spanish colonizers in the 16th century. The technique of toasting rice in oil before adding liquid comes from Spanish "sofrito" cooking methods, adapted with indigenous Mexican ingredients like tomatoes and chilies.

This dish represents the mestizaje (cultural mixing) that defines Mexican cuisine - Spanish techniques combined with New World ingredients. In Mexican households, rice is often served as a "sopa seca" (dry soup) course before the main meal, or as an essential accompaniment to beans, creating the protein-complete combination that has sustained Mexican families for generations.

The deep, toasted flavor achieved by properly browning the rice is crucial to authentic Mexican rice. This technique, called "freír" (frying), creates the nutty foundation that distinguishes restaurant-quality Mexican rice from bland, steamed versions.

## Tips for Success
- Use long-grain rice for best texture - avoid short-grain or instant rice
- Don't rush the toasting step - golden rice equals better flavor
- Keep broth warm to prevent temperature shock when adding to hot rice
- Resist the urge to stir during cooking - this makes rice gummy
- If rice seems dry, add a bit more warm broth
- For deeper color, add a pinch of saffron or bijol (achiote)
- This rice is perfect for absorbing the carnitas cooking juices
