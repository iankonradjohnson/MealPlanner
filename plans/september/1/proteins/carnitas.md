- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil

### Braising Liquid
- 1 large orange, juiced (about 1/2 cup)
- 2 limes, juiced (about 1/4 cup)
- 1/4 cup lard or vegetable oil
- 1 large white onion, quartered
- 8 cloves garlic, smashed
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 tsp dried oregano (preferably Mexican)
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 cup water or chicken broth

### Finishing Spices
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1/4 tsp smoked paprika

## Instructions

### Preparation
1. **Prep pork:** Pat pork chunks dry and season generously with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.

2. **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 275°F (135°C).

### Cooking
3. **Sear pork:** Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in batches, sear pork chunks on all sides until golden brown, about 8-10 minutes total per batch. Remove and set aside.

4. **Sauté aromatics:** In the same pot, add quartered onion and smashed garlic. Cook for 3-4 minutes until fragrant.

5. **Add liquid:** Return pork to pot. Add orange juice, lime juice, lard (or oil), bay leaves, cinnamon stick, oregano, cumin, thyme, and salt. Add just enough water or broth so liquid comes halfway up the pork.

6. **Braise:** Bring to a simmer on stovetop, then cover and transfer to oven. Cook for 2.5-3 hours until pork is fork-tender and easily shreds.

7. **Check liquid:** Halfway through cooking, check that there's still liquid in the pot. Add more water if needed.

### Finishing
8. **Shred pork:** Remove pork from pot and let cool slightly. Using two forks, shred pork into bite-sized pieces. Discard bay leaves and cinnamon stick.

9. **Reduce liquid:** Strain the cooking liquid, pressing solids through a fine-mesh strainer. Return liquid to pot and simmer on stovetop until reduced to about 1 cup of concentrated jus.

10. **Crisp the carnitas:** Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shredded pork and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes until edges are crispy and golden.

11. **Season and moisten:** Add finishing spices and 1/4 cup of the reduced cooking liquid. Toss to combine and cook 1-2 minutes more.

### Storage & Portioning
12. **Cool completely:** Allow carnitas to cool to room temperature before freezing.

13. **Portion:** Divide carnitas evenly among 6 silicon brick containers (about 10-12 oz per container). Drizzle each with a little reserved cooking liquid.

14. **Freeze:** Lay flat in freezer until solid, then stack for storage.

## Reheating Instructions
- **From frozen:** Place in 375°F oven for 20-25 minutes, stirring once halfway through
- **From refrigerated:** Place in 375°F oven for 10-12 minutes, then broil for 2 minutes for crispiness
- **Stovetop:** Add splash of water, cook in skillet over medium heat for 5-7 minutes until heated and crispy
- **Microwave:** Defrost first, then microwave on 70% power for 2-3 minutes, then crisp in dry skillet

## Cultural Notes
Carnitas, meaning "little meats," originated in the state of Michoacán, Mexico, in the town of Quiroga during the 16th century. This dish represents the marriage of indigenous Mexican cooking techniques with Spanish influences brought by conquistadors.

Traditional carnitas are cooked in large copper pots called "cazo de cobre" using lard rendered from the pork itself. The slow-cooking method transforms tough pork shoulder into succulent, crispy-edged meat that falls apart at the touch of a fork.

In Mexican culture, carnitas are often prepared for large celebrations, family gatherings, and Sunday meals. The dish embodies the Mexican philosophy of "comida casera" (home cooking) - simple ingredients transformed through time and patience into something extraordinary.

The combination of citrus, warm spices, and slow cooking reflects the complex flavor profile that defines Mexican cuisine - bright, earthy, and deeply satisfying.

## Tips for Success
- Don't rush the cooking time - low and slow is key
- Save the cooking liquid - it's perfect for moistening rice
- For extra crispy edges, finish under the broiler for 2-3 minutes
- Pork should be fork-tender before shredding
- If liquid evaporates too quickly, cover more tightly
- Taste and adjust seasoning after shredding - it may need more salt
