- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp olive oil

### Marinade & Sauce
- 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (3-4 large lemons)
- Zest of 2 lemons
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp dried oregano (or 1/4 cup fresh)
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme (or 1 tsp dried)
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/4 cup chicken broth
- 2 bay leaves

### Vegetables (Optional)
- 2 large onions, cut into wedges
- 1 lb small potatoes, halved (optional for carb addition)

## Instructions

### Preparation
1. **Prep chicken:** Pat chicken thighs dry and season both sides with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.

2. **Make marinade:** In a large bowl, whisk together lemon juice, lemon zest, olive oil, minced garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper.

3. **Marinate:** Place chicken in marinade for at least 30 minutes (or up to 4 hours in refrigerator for deeper flavor).

### Cooking
4. **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).

5. **Sear chicken:** Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large oven-safe Dutch oven or roasting pan over medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and sear skin-side down for 4-5 minutes until golden brown. Flip and sear another 3-4 minutes.

6. **Add aromatics:** Remove chicken temporarily. Add onion wedges to the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes. Return chicken to pan, skin-side up.

7. **Add liquid:** Pour reserved marinade and chicken broth around (not over) the chicken. Add bay leaves.

8. **Roast:** Transfer to oven and roast for 30-35 minutes until chicken reaches internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) and skin is golden brown.

9. **Rest:** Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

### Storage & Portioning
10. **Cool completely:** Allow to cool to room temperature before freezing.

11. **Portion:** Remove and discard bay leaves. Divide chicken and sauce evenly among 6 silicon brick containers (2 pieces per container).

12. **Freeze:** Lay flat in freezer until solid, then stack for storage.

## Reheating Instructions
- **From frozen:** Place in 350°F oven for 20-25 minutes until heated through
- **From refrigerated:** Place in 350°F oven for 10-15 minutes
- **Microwave:** Defrost first, then microwave on 70% power for 2-3 minutes per serving

## Cultural Notes
This recipe is inspired by traditional Greek "Kotopoulo Lemonato" - a rustic home-style dish from the Greek countryside. The combination of lemon, oregano, and olive oil represents the holy trinity of Greek cooking. Traditionally cooked in clay pots, this adaptation uses modern techniques while maintaining authentic flavors.

The dish originated in the mountainous regions of Greece where wild oregano grows abundantly, and lemons are a precious commodity. Greek families often prepare this on Sundays, letting it slowly roast while attending church.

## Tips for Success
- Don't skip the searing step - it creates crucial flavor depth
- Use bone-in, skin-on thighs for best flavor and texture
- Fresh oregano can be substituted but use 3x the amount
- Save the pan juices - they're liquid gold for the quinoa pilaf
