### Aromatics
- 3-inch piece of kombu (optional, for umami depth)
- 2 dried shiitake mushrooms (optional, for extra flavor)

## Instructions

### Preparation
1. **Prep chicken:** Pat drumsticks dry and season with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.

2. **Make sauce:** In a large bowl, whisk together soy sauce, rice wine, brown sugar, rice vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, and gochujang until well combined.

3. **Prep vegetables:** Cut all vegetables as specified. If using dried shiitake, soak in warm water for 15 minutes, then slice (reserve soaking liquid).

### Cooking
4. **Sear chicken:** Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown drumsticks on all sides, about 8-10 minutes total. Remove and set aside.

5. **Sauté aromatics:** In the same pot, add onion wedges and cook for 3-4 minutes until softened. Add mushrooms and carrots, cook for 2-3 minutes.

6. **Add liquid:** Return chicken to pot. Pour sauce mixture and chicken broth over chicken. Add kombu and dried shiitake (with soaking liquid) if using.

7. **Initial braise:** Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes.

8. **Add green onions:** Add white parts of green onions and continue cooking uncovered for 15-20 minutes until chicken is tender and sauce has reduced by half.

9. **Thicken sauce:** Stir cornstarch slurry and add to pot. Cook for 2-3 minutes until sauce thickens slightly.

10. **Finish:** Remove from heat, discard kombu, and garnish with green parts of green onions and sesame seeds.

### Storage & Portioning
11. **Cool completely:** Allow to cool to room temperature before freezing.

12. **Portion:** Divide chicken (2 pieces per container) and vegetables with sauce evenly among 6 silicon brick containers.

13. **Freeze:** Lay flat in freezer until solid, then stack for storage.

- **Microwave:** Defrost first, then microwave on 70% power for 3-4 minutes per serving

## Cultural Notes
Dakjjim is a beloved Korean braised chicken dish that represents the Korean concept of "jip-mat" (home-cooked flavor). This dish originated during the Joseon Dynasty and was traditionally served at special celebrations and family gatherings.

The slow braising technique allows the tough drumsticks to become fall-off-the-bone tender while absorbing the complex flavors of soy, ginger, and gochujang. In Korean culture, sharing dakjjim represents warmth, comfort, and family unity.

The dish is often prepared by mothers and grandmothers as a way to show love and care for their families. The sweet-savory-spicy balance reflects the Korean principle of "ohang" - the harmony of five flavors.

## Tips for Success
- Don't skip the browning step - it adds crucial depth of flavor
- Gochujang can be found in the Asian section of most grocery stores
- If gochujang unavailable, substitute with 1 tbsp sriracha + 1/2 tsp miso paste
- The sauce should coat the back of a spoon when done
- Save extra sauce for drizzling over rice or vegetables
